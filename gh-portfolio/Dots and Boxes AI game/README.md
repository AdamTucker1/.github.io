# Dots and Boxes AI
Coded By Adam Tucker and Calvin Chan
This project has the user play against an AI in a game of Dots and Boxes. The game has players taking turns placing lines on a grid of dots. 
If a player creates a box, they get a point and get to place another line. The game ends when there are no more places to place lines and the player with the most points wins.

## Getting Started

Compile Source.cpp with Header.h in the same directory, using "g++ -std=c++11 Source.cpp".
./a.out to run the Source.exe file.
